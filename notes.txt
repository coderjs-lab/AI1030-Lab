Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code, allowing multiple people to collaborate on projects efficiently.
It helps manage versions of files, so you can revert, branch, or merge work easily.
Developers use commands like `git add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull` to update and share code with remote repositories like GitHub.
